# ArduBOT PRo

![Descripci√≥n de la Imagen](./images/mi-imagen.jpg)

A board designed with an Arduino Nano and a TB6612FNG that allows us to control robots.
It has 8 analog inputs/outputs that allow us to connect sensors or modules. (I have used it to connect servomotors)
It has a 3.3V output to connect sensors or modules that operate at that voltage (for example, an FPV camera).

We can control 2 DC motors (A-B) as shown in the image. The board is powered with 6-12 VDC, with a row of 8 inputs and outputs that can be powered at 5V, and another row to power devices at 3.3V.

An NRF24L01 RF module to control the robot over long distances.
